Team 1:
Create a simple logging service which writes to /usr/log/logfile
This webserver should have a resource limit:
memory 200Mi (min) and 500Mi (max)
cpu 250m(min) and 500m (max)
Mount a local directory and attach to the pod
Write logs to this local volume
prove that the logs written by the pod and received in the local directory

Team 2:
Create an daemonset with a readiness and liveliness probe
Show the difference between these two when the app runs
Generate logs to prove that they executed / executing always
Kill the app instances and ensure that when restarting these probes come to play
Maintain a failure threshold for these probes

Team 3:
Create a deployment with rolling update strategy.
Set maxsurge and maxunavailable values for the deployment
perform a rolling update
have 5 replicas for the deployment
Demonstrate that the update strategy worked
Show the difference between these two

Team 4:
Create a deployment with blue green strategy.
Bring in a new version by using selectors at service level.
Switch application traffic to new version by changing the service to a new label.
have 5 replicas for the deployment
Demonstrate that the update strategy worked

Team 5:
Create a job which executes every 10 minutes
This job uses a manifest to read temperature of a city from an external service and logs.
Let each job read the city from a flat file based on the input to the job
Maintain a failure threshold for the job
have a 5 jobs running parallel
